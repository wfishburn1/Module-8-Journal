The DriverPass project involved working closely with the client, DriverPass, who wanted me to design a comprehensive system for student-driver training and appointment scheduling. Their goal was to provide users with online classes, practice tests, and the ability to schedule driving lessons, all while having efficient management of instructor availability and user appointments. The project's focus was on delivering a user-friendly and secure platform to address these needs. One aspect of the project that we executed particularly well was interpreting and translating the client's requirements into a clear and organized system design. We carefully considered their needs and incorporated features for online class registration, appointment scheduling, and user management. We ensured robust security and tracking features, making it easier to monitor user activity and maintain data integrity.

If I were to make a revision to one part of my work, I would focus on improving system documentation. I would provide even more detailed and user-friendly instructions for how to use the system. Considering the user's needs when designing software is paramount, as users are your paying Customers; without Customers there would be no business. In the future, I would continue to conduct User Story interviews and utilize CI/CD principles with an emphasis on thorough testing, to gain a deep understanding of user requirements and make sure the product functions according to the User's desire. As a general framework, I would adopt Agile Principles to foster adaptability and flexibility during the software development lifecycle. I would continue to champion clear and comprehensive documentation for the benefit of not only the Software Development Team, but all internal and external stakeholders.
